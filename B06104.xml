            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat the Magiſtrats of <hi>Irwing</hi> having in the Moneth of <hi>January</hi> 1688, borrowed from the ſaid <hi>John Craig,</hi> the Sum of 3000 Merk<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, they with their Town Council gave Bond for the ſame; but the ſucceeding Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats in the year 1690, having given in a Petition to the Parliament, Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, That the Magiſtrats who granted the ſaid Bond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Town by the late King <hi>James,</hi> contrair to Law; And therefore craving that the Town might be freed of this Debt, and the Granters of the Bond and their privat Fortunes declared to be only therefore lyable: The Petition was remitted to the Committee of Fines and Forefaulters, who having appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe former Magiſtrats to be cited, the ſucceeding Magiſtrats did alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Warrand for citing the ſaid <hi>John Craig</hi> tho no ways concerned in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie that was betwixt them, nor did they indeed inſiſt before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee againſt <hi>John Craig,</hi> but only againſt the former Magiſtrats; But when the ſaid <hi>John Craig</hi> came thereafter to charge the ſucceeding Magiſtrats for the payment of his Money, they ſuſpended upon this Reaſon, that <hi>John</hi> the Charger had been cited before the ſaid Committee, and that the Matter was <hi>Lis pendens</hi> before the Parliament, upon which the Lords of Seſſion cemurred, and left the Determination of the matter to this High Court of Parliament, where it ſtill depends; But the ſaid <hi>John Craig</hi> having now aſſigned the foreſaid Bond to the Hoſpitals of <hi>Glaſgow:</hi> It is humbly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in behalf of the ſaid Hoſpitals, that <hi>John Craig</hi> lent his Money <hi>bona fide,</hi> to the Town of <hi>Irwing,</hi> upon the Faith and Bond of the Magiſtrats and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who were in the Government of the Burgh for the time; he neither did know, nor was obliged to notice any thing of the illegal Impoſing of theſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats and Council upon the Burgh, nor was he concerned what way they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the Money, whether for the Towns uſe or not, it being ſufficient for all perſons that lend Money to Burghs, that the Magiſtrats who for the time repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Burgh give Bond for the ſame, by warrand of their Town-Council; And it is well known, that Magiſtrats were impoſed by the late King <hi>James</hi> upon many others Burghs, and yet the Debts contracted, and other Deeds done by them, as repreſenting the Burgh, were never on this account queſtioned; &amp; it were indeed a ſtrange Paradox, if either the illegal impoſing, or undue Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Magiſtrats ſhould make either their Bonds or Deeds, while in peaceable poſſeſſion of the Office, null and void, but on the contrary, theſe Debts and Bonds do certainly oblige the Burgh, and although the Magiſtrats the Granters

            <p>May it therefore pleaſe your Grace, and the Honourable Eſtates of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, either to call &amp; determine the ſaid Action, or otherwiſe to remit to the Lords of Sesſion, to diſcuſs the foreſaid Suſpenſion, not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Citation given to the ſaid <hi>John Craig</hi> to appear before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament or Committee, and without regard to the Controverſie betwixt the ſucceeding and former Magiſtrats about the Towns Relief, wherein your Petitioners are no ways concerned; and this the Parliament are humbly intreated to do, both becauſe of the concern of the poor Hoſpitals, and that the Caſe is plainly depending by the ſaid laſt Minut lying in Proceſs, and that the Town of <hi>Irving</hi> is repreſented by their Commiſſioner preſent.</p>
